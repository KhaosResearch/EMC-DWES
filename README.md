# EMC-DWES

EMC-DWES is a hybrid feature selection method. It combines the filter feature selection (EMC) with the wrapper feature selection (DWES). EMC is the improved version of MC (You can read this article for MC: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888754318304245).
You can also download the 9 datasets. Then, you need to specify the valid string path based on the location of your datasets in your storage.
For your convenience, the results of EMC on individual datasets are uploaded as well. You can simply use those files (alphaDataset.npy) and can ignore running EMC section (lines 132-170). Note that for bigger datasets calculating EMC can be time consuming.
